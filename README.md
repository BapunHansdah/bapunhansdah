# Hi, I’m Bapun Hansdah

Developer, designer, and builder.

I started in the creative world—design, video editing, and motion graphics. Then Linux pulled me into programming, reverse engineering, and mobile security.

One early breakthrough was uncovering a data-entry scam. I reverse-engineered their app, exposed the fraud, and released a tool that helped thousands, gaining 50k+ views on YouTube.
Here’s the Google Drive link to the **[deleted video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYVmJOnXFykh847285-yoP3DozHHq97n/view?usp=sharing)**.

I later began selling coding solutions and mentorship on Telegram and **[Discord](https://discord.gg/7JHs4CGcTA)**. This eventually led to my first dev role at **[Dogswag](https://barkybrews.com/)**.

After that, I co-founded **[UnifillAI](https://unifillai.com)**, an AI-powered browser automation tool. A year of building taught me a lot about product, edge cases, and scaling. I decided to pivot and apply those lessons forward.

Today, I’m building side projects like **[Excalimotion](https://excalimotion.com)** and helping startups with automation and AI workflows.

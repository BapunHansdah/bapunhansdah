# 👋 Hi, I’m Bapun Hansdah

*Developer, Designer, and Builder.*

My journey started in the creative world—exploring design, video editing, and motion graphics. Then, I discovered Linux, and I was hooked on the world of programming (and those cool terminal visuals).

I dove deep into **reverse engineering and mobile security**. One of my proudest early moments was identifying a data-entry job scam. I reverse-engineered their application to expose the fraud and released a tool to help victims, which garnered **50k+ views** on YouTube. Here is gooogle drive link to **[Deleted Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYVmJOnXFykh847285-yoP3DozHHq97n/view?usp=sharing)**

From there, I began selling coding solutions and mentorship through Telegram and **[Discord](https://discord.gg/7JHs4CGcTA)**. This network led to my first developer role at **[Dogswag](https://barkybrews.com/)**, where I tasted my first professional success.

Later, I co-founded **[UnifillAI](https://unifillai.com)**, an AI-powered browser automation tool. We spent a year building it, but I eventually realized the edge-case complexities were too high to scale effectively. I made the tough decision to pivot, taking valuable lessons in product management and resilience with me.

Currently, I’m building cool side projects like **[Excalimotion](https://excalimotion.com)** (an animated version of Excalidraw) and helping startups with AI automation.
